<h2>Considering Contribution Types for Visualization Research</h2>

<p>We aim to promote healthy growth of the visualization community, to increase intellectual diversity, and to better demonstrate the value and impact of visualization research.</p>

</p>We began discussing contribution types at the “Restructuring IEEE VIS for the Future” workshop held at the Banff Interna-tional Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery (BIRS) in June 2018. Our discussion in a breakout session focused on broadening intellectual diversity in visualization research. We continued our discussion after the workshop and held a meetup at IEEE VIS 2018 to continue the conversation with a broader audience.</p>

<p>We identified the initial set of 25 <a href="/contribution_types.html">contribution types</a> reflective of visualization research, building on our own observations and conversations with the visualization community. We hope to extend and refine this list of contribution types, and collect more <a href="/contribution_types/algorithmic-simplification.html">example papers</a>.</p>
